//!
//! A collection of utilities to assist
//! in parsing and traversing JSON files in Rust.
//! 
//! ## Why ?
//! The main focus of this crate is to allow easy parsing 
//! of JSON, with a focus on maintaining a clear route
//! back to the original JSON source code.
//! 
//! This crate can assist in providing more useful errors
//! with JSON files for use cases such as configs.
//! 
//! Instead of a General Error, such as:
//! ```txt
//!     Invalid value for "mood": "rambunctious"
//! ```
//! 
//! A more specific and useful (Ã  la Rust) error can be given:
//! ```txt
//!     Invalid value for "mood" at [69:42]
//!         "mood" : "rambunctious"
//!                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^    
//! ```
//! The above can aid users in fixing the problem much sooner as it gives specific line and column numbers.
//!
